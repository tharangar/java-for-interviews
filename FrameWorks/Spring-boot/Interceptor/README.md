https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring_boot/spring_boot_interceptor.htm


You can use the Interceptor in Spring Boot to perform operations under the following situations âˆ’

    Before sending the request to the controller

    Before sending the response to the client

For example, you can use an interceptor to add the request header before sending the request to the controller and add the response header before sending the response to the client.

To work with interceptor, you need to create @Component class that supports it and it should implement the HandlerInterceptor interface.

How to do it manually.
