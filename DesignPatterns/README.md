Design patterns are not just using Object Oritented concepts. OO concpets are underlined the design patterns . Design patterns are non-obvious, ways of constructing object-oriented systems have been collected.

Design Patterns give you a shared vocabulary with other developpers.
Once you've got the vocabulary you can more easily ocmmiunicate with other
developpers and inspire those who don't know patterns to start learning them.
It also elevates your thinking about architectures by letting you think at the pattern level, 
not the nitty gritty object level.

### Advantages of using desing patterns

1. Shared pattern vocabularies are powerful.

2. Patterns allow you to say more with less.

3. Talking at the pattern level allows you to stay "in the design" longer.
4. Shared vocabularies encourage more junior developers to get up to speed.

## How do i use Design Patterns

Design Pattersn first should be loaded in to your brain.
Once you've loaded them to your brain with a good working knowledge of patterns, you can then start to apply them to your new design and rework your old code.

Fraemworks and libraries are not design patterns; they provide specific implemenations that we link into our code. However, libraries and frameworks make use of design patterns in their implementaions.


## Tools for your Design Tool box

1. OO Basics

    Abstraction

    Encapsulation

    Polymorphism

    Inheritance

2. OO Principles

    Encapsulate what varies.

    Favour composition over inheritance.

    Program to interface, not implemenation

    Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

3.  OO Patterns

    Stratery - Design a family of algorithms

    Observer - Define a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

    
    
## Bullet points

1. Good OO desingers are resusable, extensible and maintainable.

2. Patterns show how to build systms with good OO design qualities.

3. Pattern don't give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific applicaiton.

4. Most patterns allow some part of a systme to vary independently of all other parts.

5. Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.
