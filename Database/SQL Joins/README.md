## SQL Joins

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp


A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:


![Join for tables](table.png?raw=true "Tables")


Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.

Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:

```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```

and it will produce something like this:

|   OrderID	|   CustomerName	|   OrderDate   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|   10308	|   Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	|   9/18/1996   |
|   10365	|   Antonio Moreno Taquer√≠a	|   11/27/1996  |


Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

    1.   (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables

    2.  LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table

    3.  RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table

    4.  FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

## SQL INNER JOIN Keyword
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Ex :

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;

```

Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

### JOIN Three Tables
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:

```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
```

## SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Ex :

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```
Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).


## SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Ex :

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
```

Note: In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).


## SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword return all records when there is a match in either left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!

Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.


```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

Ex :

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

A selection from the result set may look like this:

Note: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.

## SQL Self JOIN
A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;

Ex:

SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City 
ORDER BY A.City;

```

## The SQL UNION Operator
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order

```

// Union syntaz

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

// Union all syntax

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

Ex 

The following SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;

Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, because UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!


The following SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;

The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;

The following SQL statement returns the German cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;

The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers:

SELECT 'Customer' As Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;


Notice the "AS Type" above - it is an alias. SQL Aliases are used to give a table or a column a temporary name. An alias only exists for the duration of the query. So, here we have created a temporary column named "Type", that list whether the contact person is a "Customer" or a "Supplier".


```

The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement in the UNION.
